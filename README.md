## Description
As a creative music-enthusiast you might have encountered this:

You have words, phrases, even complete lyrics in your head, but you lose **track** of them because you don't have a notebook with you or don't want to bother saving random text in your notes app.

Same for melodies and rhythms. Out of the blue, there is this amazing musical sequence. You record yourself humming, singing or even playing said soon-to-be-masterpiece on an instrument of your choice. But your default recording app might be cluttered with all kinds of **tracks** or is simply just not that... pretty. ;)

Track Companion serves as a collector for your musical ideas.
This app goes out to all upcoming songwriters, who are not yet professionals and struggle with even starting!

Since it is a starter project, there is still enough room for improvement and additions.
